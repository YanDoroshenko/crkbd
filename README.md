## General notes
* Kailh-like hotswap switch sockets are mandatory for Corne build.
* I wanted a USB Type C connector so I went with Elite-C microcontrollers, you can get any Pro-Micro compatible ones.
* I decided to socket the Elite-Cs and the OLEDs.
* I don't use per-key backlighting, so it's not covered.
* You can save a lot of money by getting cheapers microcontrollers, using normal headers instead of sockets, buying generic components (LEDs, diodes, headers, hardware, etc.) from non-keyboard parts-specific stores or not having the OLEDs.
